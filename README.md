# WeatherAndroid

The application using fragments shows us:
- general current weather
- detailed current weather
- weather forecast for the next 4 days

We can choose any location from the database and add new ones by entering the city name.

Weather Android uses the Open Weather Map API for checking weather and SQLite to operate the database.
